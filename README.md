# Scraping data with Puppeteer

This was created for the first group project called [Not another CookBook](https://github.com/RaphaCH/not-another-cookbook) as the last step in The Hill stage at the BeCode formation.

## :bulb: What was the objective?

- Manage and scrape the most relevant data from a source to populate the content of our future application

## :rocket: What was the outcome?

- Used Puppeteer to crawl the [All recipes](https://www.allrecipes.com/) website. I made a function to scrape first the main recipe categories for the recipe URLs, then used those to scrape data from more than 400 recipes at once.
